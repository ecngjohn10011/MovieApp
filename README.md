# MovieApp

## This was a self-interested project I decided to implement after completing a React Native course from Edx.

## A description of the app is as follows:
#### Visual Studio Code was used as the code editor, the terminal window was also used to download packages/libraries(eg. react-navigation) using npm and run the application using expo commands
#### Android Studio was used to provide a virtual emulator to test and debug the application alongside Chrome Devtools
#### The application was developed as an expo project and written using React Native
#### Using a RESTful web service (OMDb API) the user could browse movies and obtain information about that movie including movie name, details and posters 
#### Information from the API was chosen to be retrieved asynchronously, in a JSON format for ease in processing
